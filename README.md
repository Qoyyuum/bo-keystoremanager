# Intro

This is a Keytool GUI Web App that enables users to create keypairs and renew them too. It is built around the Java (keytool)[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/keytool.html]

## Why build it?

There is no Web app for using a Keytool. The keytool is only available as a CLI app and a Desktop GUI called, (Keystore Explorer)[https://keystore-explorer.org/]

But the application that we built for the customer is not familiar and find it difficult to create new keypairs and renew them too, especially when sharing sensitive latest keystore. Which is not OK.

## Built with JMIX

This web app is built with (Jmix)[https://jmix.io].
